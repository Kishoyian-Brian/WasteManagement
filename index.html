      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>The system operates in three simple stages. Understanding this flow helps everyone—citizens, admins, and collectors—know what to expect and when.</p>

      <div class="flow-steps">
        <div class="flow-step">
          <div class="flow-step-num">1</div>
          <h4>Citizen Reports</h4>
          <p>Residents submit waste reports via the Report Waste form. They provide location, waste type (plastic, organic, metal, mixed), and fill level. Reports enter the system as <strong>pending</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flow-step">
          <div class="flow-step-num">2</div>
          <h4>Admin Approves</h4>
          <p>Administrators log in and review pending reports. They can approve or reject each one. Approved reports are marked as <strong>approved</strong> and automatically sent to collectors as new assignments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flow-step">
          <div class="flow-step-num">3</div>
          <h4>Collector Responds</h4>
          <p>Waste collectors see approved reports as notifications. They visit the location, complete the collection, and mark it as <strong>collected</strong>. The report is then closed and recorded.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This end-to-end process ensures no report is lost, responsibilities are clear, and the public can trust that their reports lead to action.</p>

    <section class="landing-section">
      <h2>For Citizens</h2>
      <p>If you notice a full bin, overflowing waste, or illegal dumping in your area, you can report it in minutes. Your report includes your name, the exact location (street, landmark, or area), the type of waste, and how full the bin is. Once submitted, the report is reviewed by municipal staff. There is no need to call or visit an office—everything happens online.</p>

          <h3>Report Waste</h3>
          <p>Use the Report Waste page to submit a new report. Fill in the location, waste type, and fill level. Your report is stored securely and forwarded to the administration team for review. You can submit multiple reports if you see several issues in different areas.</p>

      <h2>For Administrators</h2>
      <p>Administrators manage the full lifecycle of waste reports. After logging in with admin credentials, the admin dashboard shows total reports, pending items awaiting approval, approved reports sent to collectors, and completed collections. Administrators can review each pending report and decide whether to approve it (sending it to collectors) or reject it (e.g., duplicate or invalid). The dashboard also includes a Smart Bin status overview for quick visibility of bin fill levels and priorities.</p>

          <h3>Admin Dashboard</h3>
          <p>Access the admin dashboard to approve or reject pending waste reports. Approved reports are automatically notified to collectors. You can monitor collection progress and Smart Bin status from a single interface.</p>

      <h2>For Waste Collectors</h2>
      <p>Waste collectors receive assignments only after an administrator approves a report. Once logged in with collector credentials, the collector dashboard shows a notification banner when new approved reports are available. Each assignment includes the report ID, location, waste type, and fill level. Collectors can mark each assignment as collected when the job is done. Completed collections appear in a separate list for record-keeping.</p>
